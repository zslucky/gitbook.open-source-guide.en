# What we can do?
I think most of projects were created in order to solve the real issues which we met in development. 

So I think if we are using exist projects, when we met issue, we can do a deep investigation, then fix some bugs or improve codes or even improve the documents. If we found there are no good solution, then we can create a project to solve our issues, this may also useful for other guys.
