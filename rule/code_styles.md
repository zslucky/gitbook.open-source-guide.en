# Code styles

Code style is also a important thing we should pay attention to.

Ugly code style will make other developers uncomfortable, also will cause some unexpected issues.

Like javascript, we can configure a custom [eslint](http://eslint.org/) rules to check code styles or just use [standartjs](http://standardjs.com/) rules.
