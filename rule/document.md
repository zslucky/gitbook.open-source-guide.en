# Document

Documents is the most important thing for open source project.

There are 2 kind of documents we should added.

1. **In code annotation.** \(Inline annotation, doc etc...\)
2. **Full documents.** \(Offical site, API doc, Usage, examples etc...\)

The first type of document can help code reader and developer know the code logic well.

The second type of document can help other guys to learn the project usage.

More detail we write, more people like it.
