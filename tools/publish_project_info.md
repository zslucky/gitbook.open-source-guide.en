# Publish project Info

When we finished our work and decide to release our project, how can we tell others that we finished? Luckily, like npm, every time we publish our project, it can refresh the rank.

We can also create pull request to many other `Awesome` projects.

e.g.

1. [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). 
2. [xgrommx/awesome-redux](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). \(for redux.\)
3. [jondot/awesome-react-native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native). \(for react-native.\)
4. ...
